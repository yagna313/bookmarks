    <p> <u>history of anime </u>  can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1912

        <ins>scenes</ins>anime is good <mark>many of them interested</mark> Before the advent of film, Japan already had a rich tradition of entertainment with colourful painted figures moving across the projection screen in utsushi-e
        
       <strong>a particular Japanese type of magic lantern show popular in the 19th century. </strong>. Possibly inspired by European phantasmagoria shows, utsushi-e showmen used mechanical slides and developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could each control the motions of different projected figures.

<p>The second generation of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kōuchi and Seitarō Kitayama, commonly referred to as the "fathers" of anime.[4] Propaganda films, such as Momotarō no Umiwashi (1943) and Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei (1945), the latter being the first anime feature film, were made during World War II. During the 1970s, anime developed further, with the inspiration of Disney animators, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing distinct genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre.

Space Battleship Yamato and Super Dimension Fortress Macross also achieved worldwide success after being adapted respectively as Star Blazers and Robotech</P>

<p>Before film, Japan had already several forms of entertainment based in storytelling and images. Emakimono and kagee are considered precursors of Japanese animation. Emakimono was common in the eleventh century.[5] Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left with chronological order, as a moving panorama.[5] Kagee was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadows play of China.[5] Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century.[5] The paper play called Kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street theater until the 1930s.[5] Puppets of the bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animations.[5] Finally, manga were a heavy inspiration for Japanese animation. Cartoonists Kitazawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips in the early 20th century</p>
